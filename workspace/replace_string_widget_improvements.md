# Enhanced replace_string_in_file Widget Test

The `replace_string_in_file` widget has been updated with the following improvements:

## Backend Changes (`replace_string_tool.py`)

Enhanced the tool to return detailed data structure:
- `replacedCount`: Number of occurrences replaced
- `filePath`: The actual file path processed
- `originalContent`: Content before replacement
- `modifiedContent`: Content after replacement
- `oldString`: The string that was searched for
- `newString`: The replacement string

## Frontend Changes

### Model Helper (`gpt5.tsx`)
- Enhanced `parseFileEditData` to properly extract `originalContent` and `modifiedContent` from tool output
- Added specific handling for `replace_string_in_file` tool data structure

### Widget (`FileEditWidget.tsx`)
- Improved tab calculation to show diff/before/after tabs when content is available
- Enhanced diff generation to create proper line-by-line diffs
- Fixed edge cases in diff display for better visual representation

## Expected Widget Behavior

When a `replace_string_in_file` tool is executed, the widget should now:

1. **Show proper file path** in the header
2. **Display operation status** (UPDATE with success/error indicators)
3. **Provide expandable content** with three tabs:
   - **Diff**: Shows line-by-line differences with +/- indicators
   - **Before**: Shows original file content
   - **After**: Shows modified file content
4. **Syntax highlight** content based on file extension
5. **Show replacement statistics** and metadata

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Use any agent with `replace_string_in_file` tool
2. Make a file modification request
3. The widget should now display:
   - ✅ Expandable content instead of "No content available"
   - ✅ Diff view showing changes
   - ✅ Before/after content tabs
   - ✅ Proper syntax highlighting
