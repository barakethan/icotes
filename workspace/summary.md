Workspace Summary
=================

Location: /home/penthoy/icotes/workspace

Overview
--------
This workspace contains example agent plugins for the icotes system. I inspected the `plugins/` directory and found two primary agent files:

- plugins/agent_creator_agent.py
  - Agent name: AgentCreator
  - Purpose: A helper agent that assists developers in creating other agents. It includes a streaming `chat(message, history)` function, tool integration scaffolding, and robust handling for tool-call streaming and execution results.
  - Version: 2.0.0
  - Key features:
    - Uses an enhanced system prompt describing agent capabilities and tool usage patterns.
    - Provides a fallback core tools list (read_file, create_file, run_in_terminal, replace_string_in_file, semantic_search) when the tool registry is not available.
    - Implements execute_tool_call(...) to run tools either via a registry (if available) or return mock responses.
    - Handles OpenAI streaming responses and tool-call streaming, executing tools and injecting results back into the conversation.
    - Includes a reload_env() function to re-check tool availability when environment variables change.
    - Contains a __main__ block for local manual testing.

- plugins/example_tool_using_agent.py
  - Agent name: ExampleToolUser
  - Purpose: Demonstrates usage of the 5 core tools. Serves as both an example and an integration/test script.
  - Version: 1.0.0
  - Key features:
    - Shows how to call semantic_search, read_file, create_file, replace_string_in_file, and run_in_terminal.
    - Provides helper run_tool_safely(...) to invoke async tool calls safely from sync context.
    - Has a reload_env() function and a __main__ demo runner.

Tooling and Environment Notes
-----------------------------
- Both agents attempt to import a tool registry from `icpy.agent.tools`. If that import fails, they fall back to either empty tool lists (ExampleToolUser) or a manually defined fallback set of core tools (AgentCreator).
- Both agents handle the possibility that the OpenAI client or tool system may not be available; they log and yield helpful messages in those cases.
- The agents try to integrate with an OpenAI client via `icpy.agent.clients.get_openai_client()` when available. The AgentCreator requires that client to perform streaming `chat` responses.
- Agents include safeguards for running async code from sync contexts (checking asyncio.get_running_loop and using ThreadPoolExecutor where needed).

Files of Interest
-----------------
- plugins/agent_creator_agent.py — main AgentCreator implementation (streaming + tool-call orchestration)
- plugins/example_tool_using_agent.py — demonstration agent using the five core tools

How to run the example agents locally
-------------------------------------
1. Make sure Python environment variables are set if you want tool/OpenAI integrations:
   - ICOTES_BACKEND_PATH — path to backend packages (optional)
   - OPENAI_API_KEY — needed if OpenAI client is used and available
2. From the workspace root, you can run the files directly for a local demo:
   - python plugins/example_tool_using_agent.py
   - python plugins/agent_creator_agent.py
   These files include __main__ blocks that print streamed outputs to the console.

Recommended Next Steps / Improvements
------------------------------------
- Add README.md describing overall project structure and development workflow.
- Create unit tests for core behaviors (tool call execution, fallbacks, chat streaming parsing). Consider using pytest and mocking the tool registry and OpenAI client.
- Implement or wire up the actual `icpy.agent.tools` registry so the fallback tooling is replaced with real tool definitions.
- Validate and harden tool argument parsing (AgentCreator accumulates tool-call argument strings; ensure safe parsing and size limits).
- Add CI checks for linting and running example agent demos.

Quick status
------------
- Agents present: 2
- Tool registry integration: Not available (fallbacks in place)
- OpenAI client: Attempted import; availability depends on environment variables and backend path

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a top-level README.md with these details and run instructions.
- Add basic pytest tests for both agents (mocking tools/OpenAI).
- Wire up a summary of all Python files and functions in the workspace.
