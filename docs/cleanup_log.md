# Cleanup Log - Housekeeping August 4, 2025

## Debug Code Cleanup Performed

### Frontend Debug Code Removed
- **File**: `src/icui/components/panels/ICUIExplorerPanel.tsx`
- **Issue**: Two debug console.log statements in directory loading function
- **Action**: Removed `console.log('Loading directory:', path)` and `console.log('Directory contents received:', directoryContents)`
- **Reason**: These were development debugging statements that are not needed in production

## Debug Code Left Intentionally
The following debug/logging code was reviewed and left intentionally:

### Connection Management Logging (Legitimate)
- **Files**: `src/services/connection-manager.ts`, `src/services/websocket-migration.ts`
- **Reason**: These console.log statements provide important production logging for WebSocket connection status, reconnection attempts, and service health monitoring

### Error Logging (Legitimate)
- **Files**: Various service files
- **Reason**: console.error statements provide important error reporting and should be preserved

### Agent Tool Call Logging (Intentional)
- **Files**: `backend/icpy/agent/personal_agent.py`
- **Reason**: Print statements for tool calls appear to be intentional for monitoring agent behavior and debugging tool usage

### CLI Error Handling (Legitimate)
- **Files**: `backend/icpy_cli.py`
- **Reason**: Print statements are appropriate for CLI error reporting

## Summary
- **Removed**: 2 debug console.log statements from frontend
- **Preserved**: All legitimate logging and error handling code
- **Result**: Cleaner development experience while maintaining production logging capabilities
